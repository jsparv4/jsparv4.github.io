          American Trust Company, a subsidiary of EdgeCo Holdings, LP, based in
          Lexington, KY, appointed me as a Financial Operations Specialist in
          September 2023. In this role, I oversee billing operations for the
          company's legacy blocks of business and handle quarterly revenue
          reporting for retirement plans grouped by institution. Moreover, I
          proficiently run ad hoc queries on the internal FIRSTRACâ„¢ billing
          database for quality assurance and reporting. Leveraging my expertise
          in Python scripting, I automate input/output operations on numerous
          files, enhancing efficiency in file management. Furthermore, I take
          the lead in quality assurance efforts post-onboarding of retirement
          plans, ensuring fee accuracy and compliance. Overall, my role involves
          meticulous attention to detail, analytical problem-solving skills, and
          a proactive approach to process optimization.
